# Django AWS Config

Django AWS Config is aimed to help simplify AWS credential management for packages such as
[django-storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages). You can fully customise your credentials to how you need. 
Whether that means one access key per task (e.g. one for public media, one for private media, one for static files) or one 
login for all, you can do anything.
