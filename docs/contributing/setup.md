To setup the project follow our [`Getting Started`](../user-guide/getting-started/) guide. It goes through initial install, 
configuration setup, and basic usage. To contribute to the project you need to test your changes really, so we suggest setting 
up a new django project (v5 would be ideal) and installing and testing django-aws-config on that.
