title: Github Issues
---

Our main development area for this project is our [Github](https://github.com/Strelix/django-aws-config). On github you can create 
`Issues`. These are a sort of discussion that you can open which keeps lots of messages, code snippets and progress in one place.

When suggesting an idea, we would rather you first start off a
[`discussion`](https://github.com/Strelix/django-aws-config/discussions/new?category=ideas). This allows us to talk about the idea 
before any development is made on it. After we'll convert it to an `Issue`.

??? bug "Found a bug?"
    Use Github Issues for bug reports too! You can fill in the `Bug Report Form` to report these bugs to help us reproduce them.
